# Shopify Sheets Catalog - Development Milestones

## Overview
This document outlines the complete development roadmap for the Shopify Sheets Catalog Management System. Each milestone includes deliverables, acceptance criteria, and component-based architecture considerations.

## Key Decisions (Must Lock Before Development)

### 1. Final Column List Per Tab
- **Products**: id, _hash, _last_synced_at, created_at, updated_at, title*, handle, body_html, vendor, product_type, tags, status, published, published_at, template_suffix, seo_title, seo_description, _action, _errors
- **Variants**: id, product_id, _hash, _last_synced_at, created_at, updated_at, inventory_item_id, title, option1, option2, option3, sku, barcode, price*, compare_at_price, cost, weight, weight_unit, inventory_policy, inventory_management, fulfillment_service, requires_shipping, taxable, tax_code, _action, _errors
- **Inventory**: variant_id, inventory_item_id, location_id, location_name, sku, _hash, _last_synced_at, available*, _action, _errors
- **MF_Products**: id, owner_id, _hash, _last_synced_at, created_at, updated_at, namespace*, key*, value*, type, description, _action, _errors
- **MF_Variants**: id, owner_id, product_id, _hash, _last_synced_at, created_at, updated_at, namespace*, key*, value*, type, description, _action, _errors
- **Images**: id, product_id, variant_ids, _hash, _last_synced_at, created_at, updated_at, src, width, height, alt, position, new_src, _action, _errors

*Required fields

### 2. Metafield Strategy
**Decision**: Auto-update on existing namespace/key combination
- If metafield exists with same namespace+key → update value
- Track original vs new values in audit log
- Provide warning in dry-run for overwrites

### 3. Default Image Sources + De-duplication Policy
**Decision**: Support multiple sources with URL-based de-duplication
- **Primary**: Public URLs (fastest, no upload needed)
- **Secondary**: Shopify Files (for private assets)
- **Tertiary**: Google Drive (with public sharing)
- **De-dup**: Hash-based comparison of source URLs

### 4. Volume Alert Threshold
**Decision**: 200 modified rows triggers confirmation dialog
- Show summary of changes before proceeding
- Allow override for admin users
- Log all bulk operations with row counts

### 5. Admin Roles & Read-Only Mode
**Decision**: Email-based admin list with global read-only toggle
- Admin emails stored in Config tab
- Read-only mode blocks all export operations
- Non-admins can import and validate only

### 6. Environments
**Decision**: Sandbox-first approach
- **Sandbox**: Test shop for development and testing
- **Production**: Live shop with additional safeguards
- Environment indicator in UI header
