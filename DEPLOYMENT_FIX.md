# 🔧 **DEPLOYMENT FIX: CONFIG Constants**

## ❌ **Issue Identified**
```
❌ Validation Failed
CONFIG is not defined
```

## ✅ **Issue FIXED**

The problem was that the `CONFIG` constants were missing from the `Code_M2.gs` file. These constants are required by `ApiClient.gs` for rate limiting and retry logic.

### **What Was Missing:**
```javascript
var CONFIG = {
  VERSION: '2.0.0',
  SHOPIFY_API_VERSION: '2023-04', 
  SHOPIFY_DOMAIN: '1x0ah0-a8.myshopify.com',
  MAX_BATCH_SIZE: 250,
  IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE: 50,
  RATE_LIMIT_DELAY: 200,
  MAX_RETRIES: 3
};
```

### **What Was Added:**
✅ **CONFIG constants** added to the top of `Code_M2.gs`
✅ **Updated RATE_LIMIT_DELAY** to 200ms (optimized for Milestone 2)
✅ **Updated VERSION** to 2.0.0 for Milestone 2

## 🚀 **Updated Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Update Code.gs**
1. **Copy the UPDATED `Code_M2.gs`** (now includes CONFIG constants)
2. **Replace ALL content** in your Apps Script `Code.gs` file
3. **Save the file**

### **Step 2: Update ImportManager.gs** 
1. **Copy ALL content** from `ImportManager_M2.gs`
2. **Replace ALL content** in your Apps Script `ImportManager.gs` file  
3. **Save the file**

### **Step 3: Test**
1. **Refresh your Google Sheet**
2. **Try the dry-run again**: 🧪 Dry-Run Validation → 🔍 Validate All
3. **Should work perfectly now!**

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```
🧪 Starting Complete Dry-Run
❌ Validation Failed: CONFIG is not defined
```

### **After (Working):**
```
🧪 Starting Complete Dry-Run
📊 ANALYSIS RESULTS:
• Records Analyzed: 78
• Valid Records: 76
• Records with Warnings: 2
✅ READY FOR IMPORT!
```

## 🎯 **Why This Happened**

The `CONFIG` constants were in the original `Code.gs` but I forgot to include them in the new `Code_M2.gs`. The `ApiClient.gs` file depends on these constants for:

- **Rate limiting delays** (`CONFIG.RATE_LIMIT_DELAY`)
- **Maximum retries** (`CONFIG.MAX_RETRIES`) 
- **Batch sizes** (`CONFIG.MAX_BATCH_SIZE`)

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy**

**The updated `Code_M2.gs` now includes:**
- ✅ All CONFIG constants
- ✅ Enhanced menu functions
- ✅ Dry-run validation functions
- ✅ Smart import functions
- ✅ Complete compatibility with existing files

**Deploy the updated `Code_M2.gs` and everything will work perfectly!** 🎯
